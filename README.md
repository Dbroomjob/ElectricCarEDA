This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of electric vehicle registrations from Washington State.  The EDA utilizes various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, histograms, heatmaps, PCA plots, and line graphs, to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.  Key findings include Tesla's dominance in vehicle makes, the prevalence of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) over Plug-in Hybrids (PHEVs), and the concentration of registrations in King County.  The analysis also explores correlations between model year, electric range, and MSRP, revealing that newer models tend to have longer ranges and that range is weakly correlated with price.

Further analysis delves into the distribution of vehicle features, showing a bimodal distribution for model year and skewed distributions for both electric range and MSRP.  A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlights a potential outlier vehicle.  Finally, a time series analysis of registrations reveals a significant increase in recent years followed by a projected sharp decline in 2025.  The notebook concludes that these findings provide valuable insights into the electric vehicle market and suggest areas for further investigation, such as the reasons behind the projected registration decline.
